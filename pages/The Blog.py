        This was by far, my hardest project. After all, i only had scrap parts ;-;.
        This project was made ENTIRELY by scrap laptops.
                 
        One day, I was bored, and I thought, 'why don't i make a gaming laptop, it can't be that hard, right?'
        I took out 3 old laptops, and selected an HP ProBook 6460b as my base.
        I also had an ancient Toshiba Portege and a newer ProBook.
                 
        The reason I took the older model was because the new ProBook opens from the keyboard,
        and, the 6460b had a faster CPU and more RAM. I decided to put an SSD in and slotted in 8 gigs of ram.
        I installed Windows 10 and currently have the bare minimum drivers... I have more but there were hardly 3 installed...
        
        Soon, when I feel like it, I'll run benchmarks and install games, but till then,
        we won't have any updates.
                 
        Expect an update by late April, peace!
